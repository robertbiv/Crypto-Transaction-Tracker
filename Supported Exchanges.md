1. Certified Exchanges (Pro Tier)
These exchanges have verified integrations with the CCXT team. They are the most reliable options for production trading bots and serious applications because their API connectors are actively maintained and often supported by the exchanges themselves.

 # Supported Exchanges

This document lists exchanges supported by the project. Exchanges are grouped into two tiers:

- **Certified Exchanges (Pro Tier)** — Verified integrations that receive priority maintenance and often support advanced features (e.g., CCXT Pro WebSocket feeds).
- **Supported Exchanges (Standard Tier)** — Exchanges supported by CCXT; these are generally stable but may rely more on community contributions for updates.

## Key Differences in Support Level

- **Certified:** Priority support for bug fixes and maintenance; often includes access to Pro features (e.g., low-latency feeds, advanced WebSocket support).
- **Supported:** Suitable for typical REST API operations (balances, orders, trades). May lag on niche or new features and rely on community updates.

## Notes

- This list reflects the project's integrations with CCXT and community-contributed connectors. If you need an exchange added or upgraded to Certified, open an issue or contribute a patch.
- For automation and production use, prefer Certified exchanges where possible for reliability.
