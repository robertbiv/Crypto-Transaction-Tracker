# Machine Learning & NLP Dependencies (Optional)
# Install only if you want to use ML fallback with Gemma model
# Usage: pip install -r requirements-ml.txt

# These dependencies are REQUIRED if you enable:
# - ML fallback (ml_fallback.enabled = true)
# - Accuracy mode (accuracy_mode.enabled = true)

# Note: These are large packages (~10GB+ disk space for models)
# The application will work fine without these - it will use basic rule-based classification
